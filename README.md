Certainly! Below is the **rewritten summary** and **updated `README.md`** that includes your GitHub repository link.

### **Short Summary of the Project**

This project focuses on predicting **DON mycotoxin concentration** in corn samples using **hyperspectral imaging data**. The pipeline includes the following key components:

1. **Data Exploration**: A Jupyter notebook (`data_exploration.ipynb`) is used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations of DON concentration distribution, correlation heatmaps, and outlier detection.

2. **Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed by handling missing values, normalizing features, and reshaping the data for model training.

3. **Model Training**: A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained on the hyperspectral data, alongside other models like XGBoost, LightGBM, TPOT, and AutoKeras. The CNN achieves the best performance with metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R².

4. **Model Deployment**: The trained CNN model is deployed as a **FastAPI** application, allowing users to upload a CSV file containing hyperspectral data and receive predictions for DON concentration. The API also calculates evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, R²) for the predictions.

5. **Containerization**: The application is containerized using **Docker**, making it easy to deploy and run in any environment.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Logs are generated for debugging and monitoring the pipeline, ensuring transparency and traceability.

7. **Unit Tests**: Unit tests are included to validate the functionality of the pipeline components.

8. **GitHub Repository**: The complete code and documentation for this project are available on GitHub: [https://github.com/328prashant16/hyperspectral_don_prediction](https://github.com/328prashant16/hyperspectral_don_prediction).

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, evaluating, and deploying a machine learning model for a real-world agricultural use case.

# Hyperspectral Imaging Pipeline for DON Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts **DON mycotoxin concentration** in corn samples using **hyperspectral imaging data**. The pipeline includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using **FastAPI**. The complete code and documentation are available on GitHub: [https://github.com/328prashant16/hyperspectral_don_prediction](https://github.com/328prashant16/hyperspectral_don_prediction).

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Visualizations of DON concentration distribution, correlation heatmaps, and outlier detection.
- **Model Training**: CNN, XGBoost, LightGBM, TPOT, and AutoKeras models are trained and evaluated.
- **Model Deployment**: The best-performing model (CNN) is deployed as a **FastAPI** application.
- **Containerization**: The application is containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment.
- **Logging**: Detailed logs are generated for debugging and monitoring.
- **GitHub Repository**: The complete code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/328prashant16/hyperspectral_don_prediction).

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/328prashant16/hyperspectral_don_prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python src/preprocessing.py
   python src/train.py
   python src/evaluate.py
   python src/api.py
   ```

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA.
- `src/`: Source code for the pipeline.
- `models/`: Saved models and scalers.
- `tests/`: Unit tests.
- `logs/`: Logs for debugging and monitoring.
- `images/`: Visualizations.
- `Dockerfile`: For containerization.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Deployment
### Running the FastAPI Application
To deploy the model as a FastAPI API:
```bash
python src/api.py
```
The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You can interact with the API using the `/predict_csv` endpoint.

### Example API Request
You can test the API using `curl` or any HTTP client:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict_csv" \
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
-F "file=@path/to/your/data.csv"
```

### Containerizing the Application
To containerize the application using Docker:
```bash
docker build -t don-prediction-api .
docker run -p 5000:5000 don-prediction-api
```
The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## API Documentation
Once the FastAPI application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:
- **Swagger UI**: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs`
- **ReDoc**: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/redoc`
